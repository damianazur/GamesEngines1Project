# Games Engines 1 Project
Assignment 1 of Games Engines 1

## Project Idea
The idea is to create an audio responsive procedurally generated tunnel that the camera will move through.<br>
I have several ideas for how the project will work and these are not entirely set in stone and will probably change as the project progresses.<br>
<br>

**Note:** The colours in the images are not representative of the final program.

The inital idea (Prototype 1) was to have an audio responsive ring that generates more rings at intervals and moves these rings futher away from the camera, creating a tunnel effect. The opacity of the ring will change as it moves further away. Additionally dots/shperes will spawn and copies of these dots will be created at intervals in similar fashion and move away from the original, creating a trailing effect. Although I couldn't capture it in the image due to my inexperience with drawing, the rings are supposed to look different from one another.
<br><br>
However, I wanted to explore the possibility of going through the tunnel itself. This could be the second stage of the music visualization when enough rings are generated to create a tunnel. The rings will can then switch to a state like in the second image (Prototype 2) where they are no longer opaque and ununiform. I plan to make the camera move through the tunnel at a speed relative to the beat. I also intend to scale the cubes within the tunnel and the rectangles that make up the rings to the beat. Dynamic colour changing will be experimented with as well to create an interesting visual experience.
<br><br>
I would also like to experiment with bending the tunnel if I have enough time.
